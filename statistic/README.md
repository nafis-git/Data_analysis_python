the problems caused by selection bias
what pseudo-random numbers are
how to perform the four most common methods of sampling:
simple random sampling,
systematic sampling,
stratified sampling,
and cluster sampling.
sampling distribution
sample size affects estimates of population parameters,

### Distributions_probabilities
- Calculating probabilities
### Exploratory_analysis
- PMF: probability mass function, or PMF,
- CDF :Cumulative distribution functions
- inverse CDF
- IQR
- Modeling distributions
- KDE and PDF
- improve visulaization
- Correlation
- Simple regression
- Multiple regression
### corrolation
In this exercise, you'll examine the relationship between a country's life expectancy (life_exp) and happiness score (happiness_score) both visually and quantitatively.
